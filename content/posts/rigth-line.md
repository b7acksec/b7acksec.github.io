Hackers hacked **Right Line**, the largest online banking software provider in Russia and the CIS.
The company cooperates with several dozen Russian banks, as well as various crypto wallets, and participates in a project to develop a digital ruble.
Responsibility for the hack was taken by hackers from the **2402** group, who leaked gigabytes of data: *backup copies of the source codes of the company's products, internal documentation, the company's cloud with official documents, and other information.*

>All information was posted in the public domain.

The **Right Line** company is an integrator of banking software for such banks as:
*Tinkoff Bank, Rosgosstrakh Bank, Avers Bank, Agroros Bank, Dom.rf Bank Kazan, Metallinvest Bank, MS Bank Rus, Renaissance Credit, Setelem Bank, Surgutneftegazbank, Uralfinance Bank, Centerinvest Bank, Chelindbank, Sdm-Bank, etc.*

>In addition, these banks have multiple subsidiaries in the CIS countries that can also be compromised.
